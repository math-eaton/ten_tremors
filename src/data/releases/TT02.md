A collection of A sides, B sides, demos, and itinerant bonus tracks comprise a formidable dual EP by Asheville-based artist son of (Jackson McMahon). Body One and Two combine into rusted, metallic basslines, apocalyptic breaks, and synthesized spaces that twist and stutter in turn before fading into a wash of stilted ambience.
