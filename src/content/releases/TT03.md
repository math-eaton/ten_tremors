Harlan Muir’s latest double album, roxbury & roxbury, too., is pensive and faraway, sketching the sound of a drifting and hazy landscape that is at once alien and familiar. Muir alternately balances a surefooted confidence rooted in nostalgic backbeats with vulnerable and meandering interludes before falling into a rained-out muzak dream.

Sparsely arranged with moonlit woodwind passages and minimal percussion lines, Muir’s warm instrumentation gives life to sparse and wistful polysynths while field recordings traverse frozen moments in time. The album transmits the quiet memory of two trips to Roxbury, New York.
