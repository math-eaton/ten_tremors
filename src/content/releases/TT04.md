held radiant is the ceaseless tumult concealed in bright light

Biting drum ostinatos mark time under improvised dreamscapes. Arpeggios spiral in centripetal stereo and peel off into lyrical rumination; Miller’s instinctive songwriting results in unpredictable melody and form. This release is a collection of eight pieces, seven of which were recorded between May and September 2020. Three pieces are solo guitar performances recorded live with no overdubs. Five feature other instruments (drums, bass, synth, sample construction) in concert with the guitar performance.
