Introducing Test Cassette 02, a benefit compilation of some of our favorite artists: an ambitious offering of ten pieces spanning a breadth of sonic interest.

Side A suggests a crystalline reverie (Lee Noble, Olive Kimoto, Kitchen) before settling into Dorothy Carlos and Webb Crawford’s improvisational electroacoustic ruminations.

A contraction to a tense, synthetic answer on the reverse (The Largest, Weels, Distancing & Saint Later) that then relaxes into Shep Treasure’s standout track “Quicksand.” Ylayali sends us off triumphantly.

All physical and digital proceeds of Test Cassette 02 will be donated to the Palestine Children's Relief Fund.
