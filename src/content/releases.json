        "description": "Harlan Muirs latest double album, roxbury & roxbury, too., is pensive and faraway, sketching the sound of a drifting and hazy landscape that is at once alien and familiar. Muir alternately balances a surefooted confidence rooted in nostalgic backbeats with vulnerable and meandering interludes before falling into a rained-out muzak dream. Sparsely arranged with moonlit woodwind passages and minimal percussion lines, Muirâ€™s warm instrumentation gives life to sparse and wistful polysynths while field recordings traverse frozen moments in time. The album transmits the quiet memory of two trips to Roxbury, New York.",
